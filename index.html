        The Pythagorean Theorem

        The Pythagorean Theorem is used to calculate a missing side length of a Right Triangle. 
        <br>
        It is introduced in the right triangle, but the Pythagorean Theorem's uses are endless. 
        <br>
        That's why it is so important to mathematicians!

        The Pythagorean Theorem was discovered by the mathematician Pythagoras.
        <br>He lived from 580 - 500 B.C.

        When using the Pythagorean Theorem, the main thing to remember is the value of the side length that you substitute into the theorem for variable c MUST be the hypotenuse length only. The other 2 side lengths are substituted into the equation for variables a and b. It does not matter which side length you substitute for variable a and b. You will get the same answer either way. But variable c, the hypotenuses's length, MUST be substituted for c and only c. Otherwise you will get a wrong answer.

        Enter the two side lengths into the boxes below. Then click Submit. The third answer will be given to you; your missing side length of the triangle.
